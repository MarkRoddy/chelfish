## Chelfish
chelfish is a tool to simplify running chef solo. The desire was to make it easy to use a
personal chef repository on a machine that is already a registered chef node (for instance
if you have a work provisioned development machine configured against your employers chef
server and you want to use your personal chef cookbooks to configure your personal 
preferences).
